            To begin, make sure you're on a computer in a relatively quiet environment without any speaking.
            This experiment will only take about 15 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the right, you will see a program in a programming language.
            Read the code and try to understand what it does.
            Feel free to test it with some input to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you understand the code:
            Pretend that an <b>advanced computer</b> is listening to your voice and writing code based on what you say.
            Use the buttons below to record your voice and give the computer instructions.
            You will instruct the computer to write the program on the right.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are encouraged to speak to the computer with a natural speaking style.
        </p>
        <p>
            After you upload your recordings, we'll ask you to fill out a short form taking about 5 minutes.
